SPP was my first experience with a real project, a project I participied when
I was in my intership in Betech, a SME in Concepción specialized in innovation,
it was a project about web site for forestal companies from Chile, this
software had an algorithm who managed the cutting pattern you needed depending
on type of wood, cut, row or timber log.

In this image, we can see the main page of the project, there's a Gantt Chart
that represents orders of products (Like Wood or Cellulose) it has the time
and the duration.

When you press in one of the orders inside the Gantt Chart, you can see the
details of that order.

Each day was passing, the system gave you the ideal cuts of SPP depending on
your orders, your stock and your production, which made the software
interesting for Forestal Companies, for this reason, I got a mission to do.

I had to make the software scalable, it needed to allocate various enterprises.

I had to make the database in a way where it was easy for new companies to join
the software while making each enterprise's data secure and only avaliable to
see for his own company.

I used my Database knowledge that I learned from Universidad del Bio Bio to do
this, and the knowledge of the ORM for Django, Django had his own administrator
page, which was nice, but I had to implement myself the scalability, it was hard
but I made it, took me 1 month of work but I learned a lot from it, because
products want to be sold for multiple people, I felt like I've learned a very
useful skill for developers.

It was my first work project and I'm very grateful for all I've learned, I'm
specially grateful to Marcelo Becar and Nicolás Loyola, which taught me a lot
about real projects, life and work and let me work very freely, and they were
always there when I needed questions.
