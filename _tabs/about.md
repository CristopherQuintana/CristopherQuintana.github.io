title: About Cristopher Quintana
---

I am Cristopher Andrés Quintana Reyes, I am a Tesist for the Career "Ingeniería de Ejecución en 
Computación e Informática" from "Universidad del Bio Bio", close to be a Software Engineer and
currently looking for a Job.

## Skills

I am very proficient at Web Developing, having experience developing in Django and Laravel for
backend and React for frontend, I know SQL and the basics and how to operate with them with ORMs
in my backend and I know the basics of Machine Learning and I have experience using Jupyter Notebook
to create Machine Learning models.

### Pros

- I am fast at creating functionalities.
- I am proficient at using google to try to find the best solutions.
- I don't like suboptimal code, and when I realize I'm going down that path, I stop and try to think
of a new solution.
- I never give up, I always try to find a solution no matter what and as fast as possible.
- I document everything.
- I am always looking to improve.
- I try to look to the solution in the documentation if possible, so the code can be consistent with
the framework and be more eficcient.

### Cons

- I struggle to remember theory, but because of that I always try to have my notes to remember that.
- I am not the best when it comes to servers, uploading a website, or cloud services, but that's because my experience as a developer 
has been more focused on the development side.
- I don't like seeing bad code even when it works and I want to modify that no matter what.
